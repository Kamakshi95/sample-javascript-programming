                There are many books on the web technologies covered in this publication. However, there are precious few on JavaScript that can be recommended to somebody who wants to learn how to build a complete JavaScript application from the ground up. Meanwhile, almost every new tech startup needs knowledgeable JavaScript application developers on staff. This book exists for one purpose: to help you gain the knowledge you need to build complete JavaScript applications that are easy to extend and maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
                This book is not intended to teach you the basics of JavaScript. Instead, it’s designed to build on your existing knowledge and discuss JavaScript features and techniques that will make your code easier to work with over time. Normally, as an application grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to add new features and fix bugs. Your code becomes too rigid and fragile, and even a small change could necessitate a lengthy refactor. If you follow the patterns outlined in this book, your code will remain flexible and resilient. Changes to one piece of code won’t negatively impact another.
            </p>
            <p>
                This book will focus primarily on client-side architecture, although it will also cover server-side topics, such as basic RESTful APIs and Node. The trend is that a great deal of the application logic is getting pushed to the client. It was once the case that the server environment would handle things like templating and communication with vendor services. Now, it’s common to deal with both of those jobs inside the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, a modern JavaScript application does almost everything a traditional desktop app would do completely in the browser. Of course, servers are still handy. Server roles frequently include serving static content and dynamically loaded modules, data persistence, action logging, and interfacing with third-party APIs.
            </p>

                You have some experience with JavaScript; at least a year or two working frequently with the language, but you want to learn more about how you can apply it specifically to developing robust web-scale or enterprise applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                You know a thing or two about programming, but you have an insatiable thirst to learn more. In particular, you’d like to learn more about how to apply the powerful features that distinguish JavaScript from other languages, such as closures, functional programming, and prototypal inheritance (even if this is the first you’ve heard of them).
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps you’d also like to learn about how to apply test-driven development (TDD) techniques to your next JavaScript challenge. This book uses tests throughout the code examples. By the time you reach the end, you should be in the habit of thinking about how you’ll test the code you write.

                If this is your first exposure to JavaScript, you would do well to study some introductory texts and tutorials before you attempt to tackle this book. My favorite is

            <p>
                It’s difficult to overstate the importance of unit testing. Unit tests are used throughout this book. By the time you reach the end, you should be accustomed to seeing and writing them. As you practice the concepts you read about, start by writing the tests first. You’ll get a better understanding of the problem domain, and you’ll be forced to think through the design for your solution and the interface you create for it. Designing for unit tests also forces you to keep your code decoupled. The discipline of writing testable, decoupled code will serve you well your entire career.

                A special thank you to the people who have contributed to the open source projects written for this book, and to all of the open source contributors who make programming JavaScript applications a much better experience every single day. As software developers, we are all standing on the shoulders of giants.
